# Sentinel — Next Actions

Living task list. Deadline **15 September 2026** (Phase 1, updated
2026-09-05 — was 7 Sep), event 22–23 Sep (was 10–11 Sep). **2 days left
as of 2026-09-13.**
Last updated **2026-09-13** (see new section below — reconciled against
actual code and real sandbox verification; several entries below were
stale/already fixed and have been corrected).
Cross-check against `REQUIREMENTS_COVERAGE.md` (the authoritative
deliverable-status matrix) and `sentinel-solution/README.md` ("Known
issues") before trusting this file if it's more than a day or two old.

## 2026-09-13 — independent-review fixes + real live-sandbox verification (done)

**Highest-priority remaining item is unchanged and still not started: the
own-feed demo video (2-3 min, §9.3) and the Model 2 "≥2 different systems"
proof/clarification.** Everything below is supporting work, not a
substitute for those two.

Fixed, tested, and committed (4 commits, `feature/statewide-operations-nav`):

- **Evidence-tier alert bypass (BLOCKER, found by independent review)** —
  `pipeline.py` was gating watchlist alerts on `identity.plate` instead of
  the triggering event's OWN `plate`/`link_method`, so a LEAD_ONLY
  appearance-match sighting could raise an ordinary plate-matched alert if
  the same identity had been plate-confirmed by an earlier, different
  sighting. Now gates on `evidence_class.classify(event.plate,
  event.link_method) == CONFIRMED`; `Alert` persists `evidence_class`/
  `evidence_class_reason`. Idempotent backfill script run against the live
  `sentinel.db`; 2 pre-existing bad alerts correctly relabeled without
  rewriting investigator history (evidence-append-only).
- **Object-level RBAC gaps (found by independent review)** — camera
  stream (HLS playlist/segment), last-detection, vehicle-crop, and alert
  list/status/ack endpoints now enforce `department_scope()`: hard-block
  for viewer role outside the owning department, audit-and-allow for
  investigator role (preserves the intentional cross-department
  vehicle-search capability, logged to `AuditLog`).
- **Self-caught regression**: while verifying the RBAC fix, found the
  vehicle-crop endpoint had briefly gated VIEWING (not just export) on
  `evidence_class.is_exportable()` — would have 404'd 99.95% of real saved
  crops (12,274/12,280 are non-CONFIRMED). Fixed; 5 regression tests lock
  this in.
- **RTSP reconnect not resetting tracker state** — `rtsp_client.py`
  cleared `last_pts_ms` to `None` on reconnect, which silently made the
  first frame of the new connection report `discontinuity=False`, so
  `pipeline.py` never reset per-camera tracker/ByteTrack state across a
  reconnect gap. Fixed with an explicit `just_reconnected` flag.
- **ONVIF SSRF hardening** — `device.xaddr` (unauthenticated UDP
  multicast reply) and `media_xaddr` (the device's own, equally untrusted
  `GetCapabilities` response) were used directly in `requests.post()` with
  redirects enabled — a hostile/compromised device could redirect the
  backend to an internal URL. Added `_validate_onvif_address()` (rejects
  non-http(s) schemes, unresolvable hosts, loopback/link-local/multicast
  targets — covers cloud-metadata SSRF) and `allow_redirects=False`.
- **Camera health masking analytics failures (live-reproduced this
  session, see below)** — `CameraRegistry.is_healthy`/`/health` only ever
  reflected RTSP stream connectivity. Added `analytics_degraded`/
  `last_analytics_success_at` tracked at the point `pipeline.process()`
  is actually invoked (stride-gated), separate from stream connectivity,
  exposed on `GET /cameras` and `/health`.
- **Real live-sandbox verification, using the real 30-camera sandbox and
  real organizer credentials**: found and fixed a real torch/torchvision
  ABI mismatch (`torch==2.12.1` + `torchvision==0.20.1`) that made every
  analytics call fail while `/health` reported all 30 workers "ok" — the
  exact failure mode the analytics-degraded fix above now catches.
  Fixed via `pip install --upgrade torchvision` (resolved to
  `torch==2.14.0`/`torchvision==0.29.0`); re-verified real, fresh
  detection events land in `sentinel.db` against the live sandbox
  (e.g. `cam11`, 2026-09-13, `car`, confidence 0.72). Plate is still
  `None` — `paddleocr`/`paddlepaddle` are not installed in this
  environment, `StubPlateReader` honestly active.
- **New, documented, NOT-yet-fixed risk**: loading the plate-detector
  `.onnx` weights still triggers ultralytics' AutoUpdate on this
  environment, silently upgrading `onnx`/`protobuf` past the versions
  `requirements-ml.txt` pins for exactly this reason (breaks
  `paddlepaddle==2.6.2` if installed in the same venv). Attempting to
  re-pin `onnx==1.14.1` failed outright on this environment's Python 3.12
  (no prebuilt wheel, needs `cmake` to build from source) — left
  documented in `requirements-ml.txt` rather than forced under deadline
  pressure. **Before ever installing paddleocr/paddlepaddle in this same
  venv**, recreate it on Python ≤3.11 or resolve this properly.
- Rebuilt the presentation deck (`build_deck_v3.py`) around the corrected
  accountability-layer positioning with real measured evidence-tier
  counts, replacing the forbidden "ANPR failure ≠ tracking failure"
  headline.

156/156 backend tests passing after all fixes (was 131 at session start).

**Still open, not touched this session:** the demo video, Model 2's
two-system proof, PDF regeneration from the new deck, `HLD.md`/
`REQUIREMENTS_COVERAGE.md` doc sync against these fixes, sandbox
credential rotation (a real credential was pasted into a chat session
this week and should be treated as exposed), camera ANPR-suitability
scoring, §63 evidence hash-at-write, integration-loss dashboard.

## Paused work — resume later

- [x] **Per-reference-model module docs (Model 1–4) — drafted 2026-09-11.**
      Started 2026-09-10 as a multi-agent Workflow run; that Workflow tool
      wasn't available in the session that resumed this, so the remaining
      models were drafted directly instead (research via forked
      subagents, writing via direct file edits) — same scope, different
      mechanism. All four module folders now exist under
      `sentinel-solution/docs/models/`, each with `ARCHITECTURE.md`/
      `REQUIREMENTS.md`/`RESEARCH.md`/`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`:
      - `model-1-registry-gis/` — **re-verified 2026-09-11**: all four 🟡
        gaps found in the original 2026-09-10 pass were independently
        confirmed closed by `3306db6` (ageing tracking, coverage-radius
        layer, search filters, onboarding audit trail); docs updated to
        reflect this. Also caught and fixed a stale claim in
        `REQUIREMENTS_COVERAGE.md` line 27 ("camera health/maintenance-
        status monitoring" was marked fully ✅ but maintenance-status
        beyond healthy/unhealthy was never built) — downgraded to 🟡 with
        the same caveat as the module doc, so the two docs no longer
        disagree.
      - `model-2-unified-viewing/` — ground-truthed against real code;
        no required-tier gaps against the literal spec (the one 🟡,
        "≥2 different systems," is a sandbox-availability limit, not
        missing code). Documented-but-skipped hardening items: WHEP
        low-latency live view, per-camera anomaly-detection calibration,
        FastReID/OSNet Re-ID upgrade (skipped because the sandbox lacks
        enough cross-camera repeat sightings to validate a swap, not
        because it'd be hard to wire in).
      - `model-3-vms-federation/` — real build plan (not built yet, see
        "Build Model 3" below), scoped to one real adapter (wraps our
        existing Model 1/2 stack) + one real, independent, public dataset
        as the second system (NYC's "Open Parking and Camera Violations"
        open dataset, `data.cityofnewyork.us` — **revised 2026-09-11**
        after the user rejected an initial self-authored-fixture plan; a
        research pass found and selected this real dataset instead), a
        polled `FederatedEvent` table (not Kafka), and a minimal
        correlation dashboard — ~12.5 hrs / 1.5–2 days estimated. Zero
        real cross-system plate overlap is expected by construction
        (different countries) and must be disclosed everywhere a
        correlation result is shown; any populated demo match needs one
        clearly-labeled synthetic overlay, not a blended-in real one.
      - `model-4-central-vms/` — roadmap-only, explicitly not built.
        Citations independently fact-checked and corrected 2026-09-11
        (an initial research pass's unconfirmed figures were replaced):
        Ahmedabad's Command and Control Centre (Paldi, operational since
        2018) confirmed at ~6,000 cameras including 1,600 at major
        traffic junctions (deshgujarat.com) as the realistic integration
        target rather than a fictional greenfield build; NIST FRVT Part 3
        (NISTIR 8280)'s confirmed finding of up to 7,200× within-group
        false-positive-rate variation (not the earlier unconfirmed
        "10×–100×"/specific-demographic-group claim) and Delhi Police's
        confirmed 2% accuracy figure (not "1–2%", per its own 2018 Delhi
        High Court statement) as the specific grounding for excluding
        Face Recognition from any
        committed roadmap; inherits `SCALABILITY.md` §6's phased rollout
        rather than redefining it.
      **Not yet done: user review.** Presented for feedback in this
      session before any tagging — planned tags per the original note
      (`v0.2.0`–`v0.5.0` per model) are still pending the user's go-ahead,
      since a prior approval doesn't carry forward per this repo's git
      rules.

- [x] **Build Model 3 (VMS Federation & Middleware) — built 2026-09-11.**
      Decided 2026-09-10 to sequence this after Model 1+2 closed (they had,
      per `TASKS.md`'s own tracking); user gave explicit go-ahead
      2026-09-11 and it shipped the same session. Real, tested:
      `analytics/federation.py` (`VMSAdapter` Protocol, `SentinelAdapter`
      wrapping our own real data, `NycOpenDataAdapter` parsing a real
      2,000-row slice of NYC Open Data's public "Open Parking and Camera
      Violations" dataset — downloaded live from its Socrata API, not
      fabricated), a polled `FederatedEvent` table with idempotent
      ingest (`main.py`'s `federation_ingest_loop`), a correlation engine
      (`routes_federation.py`'s `GET /federation/correlations`, reusing
      Model 2's `link_score` explainability vocabulary), a frontend
      dashboard (`FederationDashboard.jsx`), and a PDF export reusing
      Model 1's `reportlab` pattern. 15 new regression tests, full backend
      suite 70/70 passing. A real sample report
      (`docs/assets/sample_federation_report.pdf`) was generated
      end-to-end and shows **0 correlated plates** — the honestly-
      predicted outcome (zero real plate overlap between Gujarat and NYC
      vehicles, disclosed everywhere via the response's `honesty_note`),
      now empirically confirmed rather than just theorized. System B is
      real public data, not a second Gujarat departmental VMS — see
      `sentinel-solution/docs/models/model-3-vms-federation/` for the
      full design rationale, including the earlier rejected
      self-authored-fixture plan and why the user asked for a real
      dataset instead. `docs/hackathon/REQUIREMENTS_COVERAGE.md` gained a
      new §C for this (sections C–F renumbered to D–G accordingly).
      **Still open:** tagging (`v0.4.0` per the original plan) is pending
      user review of this build; a demo script/video for Model 3 doesn't
      exist yet.

## P0 — hard submission blockers

- [x] **Camera-registry auto-population — closed 2026-09-10.**
      `main.py`'s health-sync loop auto-creates a bare `CameraRegistry`
      row for any active worker, so the "empty-looking app" risk was
      already gone (confirmed 2026-09-05). Ran
      `scripts/onboard_from_catalogue.py` against the live 30-camera
      sandbox for real to close the remaining department/GIS-metadata
      gap. **Found and fixed a real regression risk first**: the script
      unconditionally overwrote `department`/`latitude`/`longitude` with
      its keyword-inference result even when that inference was `None`
      — running it as-is would have wiped the 5 already-correct manual
      department tags (cam01-05: Police/Municipal Corporation/GSRTC/
      Health/Panchayat) back to unassigned. Fixed by having the script
      fetch the current registry state first and only override a field
      when its own inference actually found something, falling back to
      the existing value otherwise. Verified end-to-end against the live
      sandbox: all 30 cameras now carry real location names from the
      catalogue; GPS coordinates populated for 22/30 (8 have no
      confident area-centroid match); department stays honestly at 7/30
      (cam01-05 preserved + cam17→GSRTC/cam19→Panchayat newly matched by
      keyword) — the other 23 real camera names (street/landmark names,
      not department-suggestive) genuinely can't be classified without
      organizer-provided ground truth or manual per-camera investigation,
      not a script bug. Full backend suite 55/55 passed after the fix.
- [ ] **Record the own-feed demo video** (§9.3, 2–3 min, must show a real
      working backend, no mock-ups). Script: `DEMO_SCRIPT_OWN_FEED.md` +
      `scripts/demo_end_to_end.py` with `SENTINEL_DEMO_PERSIST=1`, then
      `python -m app.main` + `npm run dev` and screen-record the UI walkthrough.
      **Organizer guidance received 2026-09-05** (their core team, relayed
      by the user): for this demo, using any clearly-visible real sandbox
      camera is fine — no longer needs to be literally "our own feed."
      `cam06` (a real, close-range, front-facing camera identified today)
      now has a genuinely strong headline result: a real car's plate
      (`GJ01RP6128`) read correctly 4/5 times, confirmed via the actual
      `tracker.py` consensus-vote logic to produce an accepted
      confidence-0.81 read — not just a promising OCR string (see `HLD.md`
      §3). **Lead the video with this real result**, not the
      synthetic-composite montage. Still need the terminal "it's real"
      proof shot, captions, and final `ffmpeg` concatenation. **Still the
      single highest-leverage remaining task.**
- [x] ~~Record the government-feed demo video~~ (§9.4) — **externally
      blocked, per organizer guidance 2026-09-05**: the hackathon's own
      core team said their sandbox is still being fixed on their end for
      this specific test case. Don't force this recording; revisit once
      they signal it's ready. (The HLS live-view proxy bug that was
      independently blocking this — a CDN User-Agent gate — is fixed on
      our side regardless, so we're ready the moment their sandbox is.)
- [x] Solution Presentation (PPT) — v2 done 2026-09-04.
- [x] Technical Proposal / HLD — `sentinel-solution/docs/HLD.md`
- [x] Scalability Strategy — `sentinel-solution/docs/SCALABILITY.md`
- [x] Real-footage ANPR accuracy measurement — done 2026-09-05, corrected
      twice same day, now conclusively positive: initial scan found 0
      reads with only wide-overview cameras inspected; reviewing all 30
      cameras found `cam06` (close-range, ANPR-suitable) and a second real
      bug (two-line-plate/homoglyph matching in `anpr.py`) — fixed. A full
      30-camera re-scan with both fixes then found a real car's plate
      (`GJ01RP6128`) read correctly 4/5 times, confirmed via the actual
      production consensus-vote logic to produce an ACCEPTED
      confidence-0.81 read. Real, correct, end-to-end ANPR on live
      government sandbox footage — not a promising string, the real
      accept-path, locked in as a regression test
      (`test_consensus_plate_real_cam06_vehicle_clears_confidence_gate`).
      See `HLD.md` §3.
- [x] HLS proxy 502/403 — done 2026-09-05 (CDN User-Agent gate, fixed in
      `catalogue.py`).
- [x] ANPR two-line-plate + homoglyph OCR bug — done 2026-09-05, see above.

## P1 — do before/alongside the videos if time allows

**Re-researched 2026-09-10** (4 parallel research-only passes, no code
changed yet — findings below replace the previous vague entries with
confirmed status + a concrete described fix for each).

- [x] **Stale-search race — fixed 2026-09-10.** Confirmed the race
      survived the frontend rebuild in both `VehicleIntelligence.jsx` and
      `SearchView.jsx` (`submit()` in each fired a plain `fetch` with no
      request-sequencing, so a slow first search could overwrite a faster
      second search's results). Fixed with an `AbortController` per
      submit in both components: the previous in-flight request is
      aborted before a new one starts, and `api.js`'s `vehicleHistory`/
      `searchByAttributes` now accept and forward an optional `signal`.
      Verified with `npm run build` (clean) and `npm run lint` (no new
      warnings); not click-tested in a live browser this session (no
      browser automation tool available) — worth a manual double-search
      check before the demo.
- [x] **`create_api_key` 200-vs-400 — fixed 2026-09-10.** `routes_auth.py`
      now imports `HTTPException` and raises `HTTPException(400, "role
      must be one of admin, investigator, viewer")` for an invalid role
      instead of returning `{"error": ...}` with HTTP 200. Regression
      coverage added in `tests/test_auth.py`
      (`test_invalid_role_raises_400`, `test_valid_role_creates_key`);
      full suite re-run, 45/45 passed.
- [x] **`search_by_attributes` truncation — fixed 2026-09-10.**
      `routes_vehicle.py` now runs a `count()` query alongside the
      limited fetch and returns `total_count`/`truncated: total_count >
      200` in the response; switched ordering from oldest-first
      (`asc()`) to newest-first (`desc()`) so a truncated response
      surfaces the most recent matches rather than silently dropping
      them. `SearchView.jsx` now shows "N of M total" and a truncation
      notice when applicable. Regression coverage added in
      `tests/test_vehicle_search.py`; full suite re-run, 47/47 passed.
      `npm run build`/`npm run lint` both clean, no new warnings.
- [x] **Gap-analysis PDF export — fixed 2026-09-10.** Added
      `GET /cameras/gap-analysis/export.pdf` (`routes_cameras.py`),
      reusing the same `_compute_gap_analysis` data as the existing JSON
      endpoint (no second, independently-computed report) and rendering
      via `reportlab` (added to `requirements.txt`, not previously a
      dependency) — summary table, cameras-by-department breakdown, and
      each gap category's camera-id list. Same department-scoping as the
      JSON endpoint and the CSV export. `GapAnalysisPanel.jsx` got an
      "Export PDF" button (`api.js`'s `downloadGapAnalysisPdf` — fetches
      as a blob since the API key is a custom header, not a cookie, so a
      plain `<a href>` can't authenticate). Regression coverage in
      `tests/test_gap_analysis_pdf.py` (including a real bug caught by
      the empty-department-breakdown test: `[header] + [rows] or
      [fallback]`'s `or` never fires because concatenation is always
      truthy — fixed with explicit parens before it shipped). A real
      sample PDF was generated end-to-end against the live 30-camera
      sandbox catalogue (not synthetic data) via a temporary,
      immediately-revoked admin key and saved to
      `docs/assets/sample_gap_analysis_report.pdf` for the submission.
      Full backend suite re-run, 50/50 passed; `npm run
      build`/`npm run lint` both clean.
- [x] **Doc-honesty points — closed 2026-09-10.**
      1. **Multi-vendor wording** — `docs/submission/EMAIL_DRAFT.md`
         reworded: no longer implies proven integration with
         VISWAS/NETRAM/TRINETRA, now explicit that this submission
         demonstrates the architecture against the hackathon sandbox,
         not a live connection to those systems.
      2. **Private/commercial CCTV coverage** — added a paragraph to
         `HLD.md`'s onboarding section: same onboarding flow as
         departmental cameras, tagged by owning entity, contingent on
         that entity's access grant; explicitly labeled design-only, not
         built or demonstrated.
      3. **External-DB integration honesty** — confirmed already closed,
         `HLD.md`'s "query, don't copy" principle already states this
         explicitly for VAHAN/SARTHI/eGujCop/CCTNS.
      `MODULE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`'s discussion points section updated to
      mark all 3 resolved. Docs-only change, no code touched.
- [x] **`CODEX_HANDOFF_PROMPT.md`'s ML-3 — run for real 2026-09-10, real
      findings, threshold intentionally NOT changed.** New
      `scripts/calibrate_embedding_threshold.py` run against the actual
      accumulated `sentinel.db` (11,832 real crops). **Positive side
      (recall): still genuinely blocked** — only 6 events have both a
      crop and plate, 0 plates repeat across cameras, only 4 identity
      links were ever plate-verified (not appearance-circular) — a
      concrete number confirming the same conclusion this item already
      had, not a new gap. **Negative side (false-positive rate): a real,
      concerning finding** — 41.87% of 3,000 confirmed-different-vehicle
      real crop pairs scored ≥ the current 0.80 threshold (median
      negative-pair score 0.776, right at the threshold) —
      `ColorHistogramEncoder` is a weak discriminator on this dataset.
      **Deliberately did not raise the threshold**: doing so on
      negative-only evidence with zero positive/recall data risks
      silently breaking the system's actual documented differentiator
      (cross-camera identity continuity without a plate read) — a
      measured false-positive fix traded for an unmeasurable
      false-negative regression isn't a net improvement (confirmed via
      `advisor` before deciding). Cross-checked against the same day's
      Model 1 gap-analysis work: the demo-lead camera (`cam06`) HAS GPS
      set, so `identity.py`'s geo-feasibility gate is active and
      compensating for the weak embedding on the actual headline demo
      case; residual exposure is the ~8/30 cameras with no GPS at all,
      where the weak embedding is the only gate. Full writeup + numbers
      in `CODEX_HANDOFF_PROMPT.md`'s ML-3 section; `identity.py`'s
      `EMBEDDING_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` comment updated to cite this,
      not a guess. Full backend suite 55/55 passed (comment/script-only
      change, no runtime behavior changed).
- [x] **Per-character consensus voting in `tracker.py`'s
      `consensus_plate()` — done 2026-09-10.** Replaced exact-string
      majority vote with position-weighted character voting: `Track` now
      keeps raw `plate_reads` (not pre-bucketed by exact string), reads
      are grouped by length (position voting is only meaningful within
      same length — a different-length read is either a different plate
      or a dropped/added-character OCR miss, no edit-distance alignment
      attempted, per this item's documented scope), the length-group with
      the most total confidence wins, and the final plate/confidence come
      from a per-position confidence-weighted vote (ties broken by
      first-seen character, matching the old algorithm's tie-break).
      Confidence is the weakest position's vote share, which — proven by
      hand-deriving all 4 existing test cases before touching code —
      reproduces the OLD algorithm's numbers exactly whenever all reads
      share one length (all 4 pre-existing `test_consensus_plate_*` tests,
      including the real cam06 regression test, pass unchanged with
      identical confidence values). Two new tests added:
      `test_consensus_plate_position_voting_recovers_read_exact_string_voting_would_fail`
      (the actual documented gap: 5 reads with 5 DIFFERENT single-char
      misreads at 5 different positions — old algorithm sees 5 equal-vote
      candidates at 0.2 confidence each, rejected below
      `PLATE_MIN_CONFIDENCE`; new algorithm recovers the correct plate at
      0.8, clearing the gate) and
      `test_consensus_plate_different_length_reads_grouped_separately`
      (a dropped-character read doesn't get position-voted against
      correct-length reads). Full suite 55/55 passed.

## P2 — known code issues, not yet fixed (lower demo-visibility risk)

- [ ] **`tracker.py`'s `consensus_plate()` can synthesize a plate string
      that matches no actual OCR read, if a track's `plate_reads` ever mix
      two different vehicles' reads (an IOU-overlap association merging a
      second car into an existing track — e.g. one vehicle leaving a
      queued spot right as another pulls into the same bbox within
      `TRACK_TIMEOUT_MS`).** Found and investigated by an independent
      project review (2026-09-11); locked in as a real, passing regression
      test
      (`test_consensus_plate_can_synthesize_a_string_that_matches_no_actual_read`),
      not left silently unflagged. **Two fix attempts were tried and both
      reverted, on evidence**: a post-hoc confidence penalty in
      `consensus_plate()`, and a plate-agreement guard at association time
      in `CameraTracker.update()` — both broke
      `test_consensus_plate_isolates_higher_vote_share`/
      `test_consensus_plate_confidence_is_vote_share_not_count`, which
      correctly require a severely-disagreeing single stray misread of the
      SAME vehicle to be outvoted, not treated as contamination; there is
      no character-agreement threshold that separates that already-
      required case from genuine two-vehicle contamination. A real fix
      needs signal outside the plate string itself (e.g. an appearance-
      embedding distance check between a candidate track's stored crop and
      a new detection's crop before merging — a genuine `reid.py`-into-
      `tracker.py` integration), not a small change — not attempted.
      (`analytics/tracker.py`)

~~RTSP discontinuity detection doesn't survive a reconnect~~ — **fixed
2026-09-13**, see the new section above. (`streaming/rtsp_client.py`)
- [ ] **No FFmpeg read-timeout on `cap.read()`** — a stalled TCP session
      can block forever instead of returning `ok=False`, defeating the
      otherwise-correct backoff/reconnect logic. (`streaming/rtsp_client.py`)
- [ ] **Frontend: Safari's native-HLS path sends no API key** and fails
      with no visible error banner (only the hls.js path attaches auth
      headers). (`frontend/src/components/LiveView.jsx`)
- [ ] **Frontend: map view doesn't distinguish OBSERVED vs. INFERRED route
      segments** — draws one uniform line regardless of link confidence,
      unlike the Vehicle Tracking timeline panel which does this correctly.
      (`frontend/src/components/MapView.jsx`, `App.jsx`)
- [ ] **Frontend: alert-list polling can race a user's transition click** —
      briefly reverts a just-acknowledged alert, second click then hits a
      confusing raw `409 illegal transition` error.
      (`frontend/src/components/AlertsPanel.jsx`)

~~VehicleIdentity history lookup uses `.first()` on a non-unique query
pattern~~ — **not actually a bug**, re-verified 2026-09-05: `vehicle_identity
.plate` has had a partial-unique DB constraint since 2026-09-04, so
`.filter(plate==...).first()` can structurally never match more than one
row. Remove from backlog.

~~Possible SSRF/credential-leak gap in the HLS proxy~~ — **already fixed**,
per `REVIEW_FINDINGS.md`'s `SEC-doc` entry (host-allowlist check +
`allow_redirects=False`) — this TASKS.md entry was stale, not a real open
item.

## P3 — nice-to-have if time remains

~~Multi-camera grid / video wall~~ — **done 2026-09-05** (`CameraGridView.jsx`).
~~Department-scoped RBAC~~ — **done 2026-09-05** (`api/auth.py`'s `department_scope`).
- [ ] WHEP low-latency preview (HLS-via-proxy is the working path; low
      priority — not required by the test case).
- [x] **Backend search/filter query params on `/cameras` — done
      2026-09-10.** Added `department`/`camera_type`/`is_healthy`/`live`
      (exact match) and `q` (case-insensitive substring on id/location)
      as optional query params on `GET /cameras`; applied after
      department-scoping so a non-admin key still can't see outside its
      own scope. No existing client-side camera-filter UI was found to
      migrate (the frontend rebuild appears to have dropped it, same as
      the old `VehicleSearch.jsx`) — left as a backend capability with
      regression coverage (`test_camera_registry_model1.py`), not wired
      to a new frontend surface, to avoid inventing UI beyond what was
      asked.
- [x] **Coverage-radius/zone GIS map layer, ageing-infrastructure
      tracking — done 2026-09-10.** Added `CameraRegistry.install_date`/
      `coverage_radius_m` (additive migration in `db/session.py`), wired
      into `CameraOnboard`/`_apply_onboard_fields`/`_merged_camera_view`/
      CSV export/`OnboardCameraForm.jsx`. `MapView.jsx` renders a
      coverage-radius `Circle` per camera with a radius set, and a
      dashed marker outline + popup note for cameras installed more than
      `SENTINEL_CAMERA_AGEING_THRESHOLD_YEARS` (config.py, default 5)
      ago. Gap-analysis JSON/PDF/`GapAnalysisPanel.jsx` all report
      `ageing`/`missing_install_date` alongside the existing categories.
- [x] **Camera-onboarding audit trail — done 2026-09-10.** New
      `CameraAuditLog` table (separate from the existing purpose-bound
      `AuditLog`, which doesn't fit a registry edit) records `onboarded`
      vs. `updated` per camera per onboard/bulk-onboard call, with
      `user_id`/`created_at`. New admin-only `GET
      /cameras/{camera_id}/audit-log`. Regression test caught a real
      ordering bug: two edits in the same test can share an identical
      `created_at` (default's resolution can tie), making `ORDER BY
      created_at DESC` nondeterministic — fixed with an `id DESC`
      tiebreak; confirmed deterministic across 5 repeated full-suite runs
      after the fix.

All three verified: real additive migration run against the actual
accumulated `sentinel.db` (not a fresh DB) — both new columns and the new
table created cleanly, no data loss. Full backend suite 53/53 passed;
`npm run build`/`npm run lint` both clean, no new warnings.

- [x] **Real ONVIF device discovery — built.** `streaming/onvif_discovery.py`:
      WS-Discovery (UDP multicast Probe/ProbeMatch) + ONVIF Media SOAP
      calls (`GetCapabilities` → `GetProfiles` → `GetStreamUri`), raw
      hand-built SOAP/XML rather than a zeep-based client (small enough
      protocol surface to avoid the heavier WSDL-parsing dependency).
      Wired into `catalogue.py`'s `CatalogueClient.refresh()` as
      ONVIF-first: tried on every refresh when `SENTINEL_ONVIF_ENABLED=true`
      (default `false`), falling back to the existing sandbox HTTP
      catalogue automatically and loudly-logged when no ONVIF device
      responds — the sandbox's actual, permanent state (§13a: plain RTSP,
      no ONVIF endpoint at all), so this is the expected fallback path,
      not an error condition. XML parsing uses `defusedxml` (new dep) to
      guard against XXE from untrusted device responses, per this repo's
      untrusted-input rule. 14 new regression tests
      (`tests/test_onvif_discovery.py`, mocked WS-Discovery/SOAP
      exchanges — no live ONVIF device is reachable from this environment
      or the sandbox to test against for real); full backend suite 84/84
      passing (70 pre-existing + 14 new), run for real in a freshly
      created `.venv` (none existed in this environment beforehand).
      **Honestly unverified against a live ONVIF-conformant camera** —
      that remains the one open gap before this could be trusted in an
      actual departmental deployment; see
      `docs/models/model-2-unified-viewing/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`'s M2-4.

- [x] **Minor hardening batch — done 2026-09-11.** `/health` now reports
      `active_camera_worker_count` (an int) instead of the raw camera-ID
      list to an unauthenticated caller; `VehicleEvent` gained a separate
      `ingested_at` column alongside `observed_at` (additive migration,
      verified against a real on-disk pre-migration DB, not just a fresh
      one); a minimal in-process rate limiter (`api/rate_limit.py`, fixed-
      window per API key/IP, no new infrastructure) now guards every route
      except `/health` and `/live/*`; `architecture.drawio` updated to
      include the Model 3 federation layer and ONVIF discovery (previously
      absent — stale relative to the actual codebase). 5 new tests
      (`test_rate_limit.py`); full backend suite 100/100 passing.

## 2026-09-12 — evidence classification audit + demo readiness (done)

**Truthful state of the evidence feature, stated explicitly per the audit
below (do not claim more than this anywhere — deck, briefing, or demo
script):**

```
Evidence classification:        IMPLEMENTED
LEAD_ONLY UI export blocking:   IMPLEMENTED
§63 evidence-package generation: NOT IMPLEMENTED
```

`evidence_class.py` audited line-by-line. One real gap found and fixed: a
whitespace-only plate string is truthy in Python, so `classify("   ", ...)`
returned CONFIRMED before this fix. Unreachable through the real pipeline
today (`anpr.py`'s `PLATE_PATTERN.fullmatch()` already rejects it), but the
function is the single gate deciding exportability and must not depend on
that upstream invariant holding forever — hardened to `plate and
plate.strip()`. 5 new boundary tests (17 total for this module), including
one that locks the classifier's signature to `(plate, link_method)` only —
structural proof a high fused UI score can never influence the class,
because the function cannot see it.

### Rule table (deterministic, exhaustive over all 4 real `link_method` values)

| plate | link_method | class | rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| any non-blank string | any | CONFIRMED | plate already passed `PLATE_PATTERN` + `PLATE_MIN_CONFIDENCE` upstream |
| None / empty / whitespace | `plate_continuation` | PROBABLE | same within-camera track as a sighting that read the plate |
| None / empty / whitespace | `plate_upgrade` | PROBABLE | same, retroactive upgrade case |
| None / empty / whitespace | `appearance_match` | LEAD_ONLY | appearance embedding only — 41.87% FPR measured |
| None / empty / whitespace | `new_identity` | LEAD_ONLY | no plate, no link — anonymous |
| None / empty / whitespace | unrecognised/None | LEAD_ONLY | fail conservative — never upgrade on an unknown case |

Only `CONFIRMED` is in `EXPORTABLE_CLASSES`. `PROBABLE` is deliberately
excluded too.

## 2026-09-12 — jury-ready UI rework + evidence tiering (done)

**Evidence classification is now real and enforced** (`analytics/evidence_class.py`).
Derived from persisted provenance — `plate` and `link_method` — so it needs no
migration and a badge can never disagree with the row it labels:

- `CONFIRMED` — this sighting read and validated its own plate.
- `PROBABLE` — no plate here, but linked by within-camera track continuity
  from a sighting that did read one (`plate_continuation` / `plate_upgrade`).
- `LEAD_ONLY` — linked by appearance only, or standalone anonymous. Not evidence.

Only `CONFIRMED` is exportable. `PROBABLE` is deliberately excluded too: an
export is where a hedge stops being visible. `/vehicle/{plate}/history` and
`/vehicle/recent` now return `evidence_class`, `evidence_class_reason` and
`exportable_as_evidence`; the frontend disables its export control from that
field rather than re-deriving the rule. 12 new tests.

**Measured over the real database:** 6 CONFIRMED, 12,251 LEAD_ONLY out of
12,257 events — an independent reproduction of DECISION_REVIEW_2026-09-11.md's
central finding. Identity `GJ01AB1234` shows the demo shape exactly: five
sightings, one CONFIRMED (cam03, where the plate was read), four leads.

**Navigation regrouped** by operator intent (Operations / Investigations /
Camera Intelligence / Evidence / Integrations / System) instead of leaking our
internal Model 1/2/3 structure into the product.

**New screens, all real-endpoint backed:** Camera Health (operational state
only — no fabricated packet-loss/latency/uptime figures, because nothing
measures them), Coverage & Gaps, Connected Systems (states plainly that
department labels behind one gateway are *not* two systems — CLAUDE.md §10),
Watchlist & Alerts combined, User Administration (`/auth/api-keys`, minted key
shown once).

**Three destinations ship an honest "not yet implemented" screen** naming the
exact backend work required, rather than being hidden or faked: Investigation
Cases, ANPR Readiness, Evidence Export (§63). Wording throughout is
"§63-oriented", never "court admissible".

Verified: 119/119 backend tests, `npm run lint` (no new warnings), `npm run
build` clean, and every new endpoint exercised over real HTTP against a running
`app.main` with the real `sentinel.db`.

### Government-feed readiness, checked 2026-09-12

| Item | State |
|---|---|
| Sandbox catalogue access | **PASS** — 30 cameras, HLS + RTSP URLs present |
| HLS playback | **PASS** — cam06 playlist 200, valid `#EXTM3U`, 14,690 segments |
| Searchable event / movement history | **PASS** — verified over HTTP |
| Persisted camera ID + timestamp | **PASS** |
| Watchlist correlation + alerts | **PASS** |
| Timestamped output report | **PASS** — gap-analysis and federation PDFs |
| Real ANPR output | **PASS (historic)** — `data/anpr_scan/20260905T112430Z`, 7 reads |
| GIS mapping | **PARTIAL** — 22 of 30 cameras have coordinates; the sandbox
  catalogue supplies none, they come from our registry |
| RTSP analytics producing new events | **PASS (updated 2026-09-13)** —
  live-verified on this machine's Python 3.12 venv against the real
  sandbox: a torch/torchvision ABI mismatch was found and fixed
  (`pip install --upgrade torchvision`), real fresh detection events
  now land in `sentinel.db` (e.g. `cam11`, confidence 0.72). Plate reads
  still absent — `paddleocr`/`paddlepaddle` not installed here, honest
  `StubPlateReader` fallback active. |
| Full government-feed demo session | **RETRACTED "externally blocked"
  status — see below** |

### Government-feed blocker retraction, 2026-09-12

**The prior "externally blocked" status was stale and imprecise.** It traced
to one undated 2026-09-05 remark — "the hackathon's own sandbox is still
being fixed on their end" — with no named endpoint, no error, and no
re-check in a week. This session verified directly against the live sandbox
today: catalogue login succeeds, 30 cameras returned, and `cam06`'s HLS
playlist returns 200 with a valid `#EXTM3U` header and 14,690 segments. The
premise of the blocker does not hold today.

**Separately, and more importantly: `HACKATHON_DETAILS.md` §12 states the
sandbox itself already qualifies as "Government-Provided CCTV Feed."**
Verbatim: *"~12 hours of CCTV footage from each of 30+ cameras, across 5
departments: Health, Police, GSRTC, Panchayat, Municipal Corporation... Real
footage, no synthetic data... served as simulated live video."* §"Phase 1 –
Sandbox Round" vs "Phase 2 – Production Round" confirms this sandbox is the
intended Phase 1 government feed; a separate production environment exists
only for the 6 Grand Finale qualifiers. The project's own prior framing — a
second, distinct "government feed" recording session, gated on the
organizers — was a misreading of the spec, not a real technical blocker.

**One genuine, narrow gap found and fixed:** Q33 requires "output report
showing detected vehicles/plates with timestamps"; no such export existed
(`ReportsView.jsx` had gap-analysis, audit-log, and watchlist reports only).
Added a "Vehicle detections report" entry reusing the existing
`/vehicle/recent` endpoint and `download()` pattern — zero new backend code.

**Status: READY NOW** for everything except a fresh live-ML detection
moment, which depends on the ML runtime (being verified on a second
machine, see above) rather than on any organizer dependency.


## 2026-09-13 — scoped Model 4 pilot slice

- [x] **AUTOMATED-TEST VERIFIED:** `CameraDensityWindow` aggregates actual
      sampled-frame vehicle/person detector outputs. `GET /admin/density`
      labels them as raw detections, not unique people/vehicles or crowd size.
- [x] **IMPLEMENTED, UNVERIFIED:** `VehicleEvent.storage_tier` and dynamic
      hot/warm/cold classification expose metadata only; no object storage is deployed.
- [x] **AUTOMATED-TEST VERIFIED:** `GET /admin/central-rollup` combines real
      pilot registry, health, alert and federation data for admins.
- [x] **IMPLEMENTED, UNVERIFIED:** `DR_RUNBOOK.md` defines a SQLite
      backup/restore procedure. Multi-region DR remains a DESIGN TARGET.
- [x] `DeliberatelyExcludedFaceRecognizer` is an honest Protocol seam that
      raises rather than fabricating FRS results. FRS and government-database
      integrations remain deliberately excluded/external-access dependent.

## Deliberately not doing (see STRATEGY.md's OUT list — don't silently build these)

Face recognition, fingerprint/biometric integration, full 80k-camera
physical ingestion, a new VMS, real per-vendor VMS federation middleware,
actually deploying Kafka/MediaMTX this week.

## How to verify any fix in this list

Per this project's CLAUDE.md: don't declare a fix done from a syntax check.
Exercise it with `scripts/demo_end_to_end.py` (real models) and/or a live
request against `python -m app.main`, including the failure mode it's
supposed to handle — not just the happy path.
