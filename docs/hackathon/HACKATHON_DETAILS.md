- Leverage AI-powered video analytics for real-time intelligence and automated alerts

Participants may adopt one of the reference solution models or propose an innovative hybrid architecture.

### Open Source Requirement
All solutions must use open-source technologies. Recommended stack (not mandatory):
- React, Python, Node.js
- PostgreSQL, PostGIS
- WebRTC, RTSP
- Kafka, RabbitMQ
- TensorFlow, PyTorch
- FFmpeg, GStreamer
- Leaflet, OpenLayers

## 6. The Problem in Detail

Gujarat's **26 government departments** each operate independent CCTV ecosystems:
- Mixed analog and IP-based cameras
- Geographically dispersed (~1,000 km, border districts to locations like Valsad, Dahod, Dwarka)
- Heterogeneous vendors, formats, VMS platforms
- Varying storage/retention periods (7–15+ days), cloud or local infrastructure
- No unified way to monitor, search, or cross-reference footage with law-enforcement databases

**Department camera usage examples:**
- Home Department: traffic and crime
- Food & Civil Supplies: storage facilities
- RTO: offices and checkpoints

**Government databases to integrate with:** VAHAN, SARTHI, eGujCop, AFIS, NAFIS (enable automated alerts for stolen vehicles, wanted persons, fingerprint matches)

**Private CCTV integration:** Solution should also support viewing public-facing CCTV from societies, malls, commercial establishments, "wherever feasible and permitted"

**Architecture principles required:** Open, modular, scalable, secure, standards-based, vendor-neutral (avoid lock-in)

## 7. Solution Models (choose one or hybrid; Model 1 is mandatory foundation)

Important: Model 1 should be treated as the common CCTV registry and GIS foundation that may support Models 2, 3, and 4.

### Model 1: Centralised CCTV Registry & GIS Mapping (MANDATORY base layer)
Metadata inventory without centralised video streaming.
- **Features:** Bulk import, API-based onboarding, interactive GIS mapping, health monitoring, gap-analysis reporting, role-based access control

### Solution Design Dimensions (all models)
Architecture, integration strategy, AI/analytics approach (ANPR, cross-camera tracking), cybersecurity/privacy/RBAC, deployment architecture, infrastructure sizing, cost-benefit analysis, scalability roadmap, department-wise information requirements, future roadmap.

## 8. Live Technical Evaluation / Test Case

**Scenario (~50 cameras):**
- Onboard ~50 geographically distributed heterogeneous (simulated) camera feeds from different departments
- Integrate live feeds into your unified platform
- Demonstrate centralised monitoring and AI-powered analytics
- Track a designated vehicle using a registration number provided during evaluation
- Present complete timestamped movement history across the camera network
- Cross-reference live feeds with a representative watchlist database (stolen vehicles, wanted persons, missing persons, blacklisted vehicles)
- Generate automated real-time alerts upon watchlist matches

**Expected output:** Vehicle identification/tracing across the network, complete route traversal with timestamped location-wise movement history, working watchlist database with continuous cross-referencing and automated alerts, evidence of CCTV integration quality, analytics quality, interoperability, scalability, performance.

## 9. Mandatory Submission Deliverables

Phase 1 (₹18,00,000) + Phase 2 (₹31,00,000) + Additional Awards (₹2,00,000) = **₹51,00,000**

## 12. Sandbox Dataset & Live Streaming Infrastructure

- **Dataset:** ~12 hours of CCTV footage from each of 30+ cameras, across 5 departments: Health, Police, GSRTC, Panchayat, Municipal Corporation
- Real footage, no synthetic data
- A Python-based middleware ingests recorded footage, synchronizes timelines, and serves it as simulated live video via dedicated streaming endpoints
- Why simulated: realistic integration experience while protecting production security and ensuring consistent, fair testing across teams

## 13. Sandbox Integration Reference — "Consuming the Sentinel Camera Grid"

Guide for teams connecting to the Sentinel sandbox at the protocol layer.

### 13.1 What you are connecting to
Every camera is published as a live RTP/RTSP stream. One second of video takes one second to arrive; frames carry monotonic presentation timestamps (PTS); there is no seeking, no byte-range fetching, no running ahead of real time. Treat each endpoint like a physical camera on an operational network.

| Protocol | Endpoint | Intended for |
|---|---|---|
| RTSP | `rtsp://<host>:8554/stream/<id>` | AI inference (OpenCV, GStreamer, FFmpeg, DeepStream) |
| WebRTC (WHEP) | `http://<host>:8889/stream/<id>/whep` | Low-latency browser preview |
| HLS | `http://<host>/live/stream/<id>/index.m3u8` | Dashboards, mobile, restricted networks |

Always start from the catalogue rather than hard-coding endpoints:
```
curl -s http://<host>/api/ingest
```
Returns every camera with id, location, codec, live status, stream properties, and all three URLs. Camera ids and the set of available cameras can change — the catalogue is the contract, the URL pattern is not.

### 13.2 Connecting — Code Examples

**OpenCV (Python):**
```python
import os
os.environ["OPENCV_FFMPEG_CAPTURE_OPTIONS"] = "rtsp_transport;tcp"
import cv2

cap = cv2.VideoCapture("rtsp://<host>:8554/stream/1", cv2.CAP_FFMPEG)
while True:
    ok, frame = cap.read()
    if not ok:
        break  # reconnect
    pts_ms = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_POS_MSEC)
    ...
```

**GStreamer:**
```
gst-launch-1.0 rtspsrc location=rtsp://<host>:8554/stream/1 protocols=tcp latency=200 \
 ! rtph264depay ! h264parse ! avdec_h264 ! videoconvert ! fakesink
```
For H.265 streams, use `rtph265depay` and `h265parse` instead.

**FFmpeg / ffprobe:**
```
ffplay -rtsp_transport tcp rtsp://<host>:8554/stream/1
ffprobe -rtsp_transport tcp rtsp://<host>:8554/stream/1
```

**NVIDIA DeepStream:**
Use `nvurisrcbin` / `uridecodebin` with the RTSP URI and set `select-rtp-protocol=4` (TCP). Streams are H.264 or H.265; both decode on `nvv4l2decoder` without CPU demuxing.

### 13.3 Do's and Don'ts

- **DO — Force RTSP over TCP.** UDP is accepted but fails across NAT and most corporate firewalls; partial UDP delivery produces corrupt frames that look like model bugs. Set `rtsp_transport=tcp` in every client. If port 8554 is blocked, use HLS instead.
- **DON'T — Trust the reported frame rate.** `CAP_PROP_FPS` (and equivalents) often doesn't match actual delivery rate. Measure the real rate yourself, or ignore declared frame rate and use timestamps.
- **DO — Drive all timing from PTS, never arrival time.** Use `CAP_PROP_POS_MSEC` (OpenCV), buffer PTS (GStreamer), or RTP timestamps — not wall-clock time at frame-read moment. On connect, the gateway replays the buffered group-of-pictures so the decoder can start at a keyframe — the first 1-2 seconds may arrive faster than real time. A tracker timestamping by arrival will compute impossible velocities right after connecting. Kalman filters/multi-object trackers must be fed PTS deltas.
- **DON'T — Assume a constant frame rate.** Frame intervals aren't guaranteed uniform. Pipelines must tolerate inter-frame gaps without treating them as disconnects; motion models must use actual elapsed PTS between frames, not a fixed cadence.
- **DO — Reconnect automatically, with backoff.** Feeds are supervised and may restart; expect brief interruptions. Reconnect with exponential backoff (start ~2s, cap ~30s). Do not reconnect in a tight loop.
- **DON'T — Treat decode warnings at join as fatal.** Grid includes H.264 and H.265. Attaching mid-stream can produce messages like "Error constructing the frame RPS" or "Could not find ref with POC" until the first IDR frame arrives — normal, self-corrects. Don't abort on first decoder error.
- **DON'T — Assume a uniform grid.** Cameras differ in resolution, codec, frame rate, bitrate. Read per-camera properties from `/api/ingest` and size batching/buffers/decoders accordingly. A fixed-shape inference batch across every camera won't work unscaled.
- **DO — Expect a scene discontinuity.** Each feed is a continuous recording that loops; at the loop point the scene cuts abruptly, like a camera reboot. Long-lived state (background models, re-id galleries, track ids) should recover from a hard cut rather than assume infinite continuity.
- **DON'T — Plan around obtaining copies of the footage.** No file download. The grid is consumed live only, and that's what evaluation exercises. `/stream/<id>` is the browser playback fallback answering range requests for a media player — pulling it with plain curl/wget yields a partial file that looks complete. Build against a live capture from the start.
- **DON'T — Publish to the gateway.** Consume only. Do not push streams to any path, and do not call the gateway's control API.
- **DO — Pace your load.** Each connected client receives its own copy of the stream. Open only the cameras you're actively processing; close captures when finished.

### 13.4 Pre-submission Checklist
- [ ] Every client forces RTSP over TCP
- [ ] No timing logic depends on `CAP_PROP_FPS` or frame arrival time
- [ ] Inter-frame gaps do not crash or stall the pipeline
- [ ] Reconnect with backoff implemented and tested by restarting a feed
- [ ] Decoder warnings on join are logged, not fatal
- [ ] Camera list and per-camera properties are read from `/api/ingest`
- [ ] Pipeline handles mixed H.264/H.265 and mixed resolutions
- [ ] Behaviour is sane across a scene discontinuity

### 13.5 Support
Report feed problems with: camera id, exact URL, client and version, UTC timestamp, client-side error log. Confirm the camera's live status in `/api/ingest` before reporting it as down.

## 13a. ACTUAL Sandbox Endpoints (Integrator's Guide — authoritative, use these over §13's generic `<host>` examples)

Retrieved from the logged-in Control Room "Integrator's Guide" page, after requesting feed access. This supersedes the placeholder `<host>` values in §13 with real values.

### Access model
- **HLS** is served over the **CDN host** (`cctv.corp8.cloud`), **behind your access password**, and works from any network.
- **RTSP & WebRTC/WHEP** carry raw TCP/UDP media that a CDN cannot proxy, so they are served **directly on the public static IP** `103.250.160.189` (or a dedicated non-proxied subdomain such as `stream.corp8.cloud`).
- RTSP/WHEP are reachable from anywhere the gateway ports are open — **no Tailscale or device registration required**.
- Gateway ports: **8554/TCP** (RTSP), **8889/TCP** (WHEP), **8189/UDP** (WHEP media).
- **Updated (2026-09-04): RTSP & WebRTC/WHEP now authenticate every connection**
  with the registered email + access password embedded directly in the URL:
  `rtsp://<email>:<password>@103.250.160.189:8554/stream/<id>`. The `@` in the
  email **must be percent-encoded as `%40`** (e.g. `alice%40example.com`) or
  URL parsing breaks. Only emails on the approved access list can connect.
  This is separate from the CDN's cookie-session login used for HLS/the
  catalogue (`POST https://cctv.corp8.cloud/auth/login`, which — also
  discovered 2026-09-04 by inspecting the real login form — requires **both**
  `email` and `password` fields, not password alone; sending password alone
  silently re-renders the login page with a 200, not an error).

### Endpoints

| Protocol | Endpoint | Reachable via | Intended for |
|---|---|---|---|
| HLS | `https://cctv.corp8.cloud/<id>/index.m3u8` | Public (password) | Dashboards, mobile, restricted networks, remote AI |
| RTSP | `rtsp://103.250.160.189:8554/stream/<id>` | Public IP (direct) | AI inference (OpenCV, GStreamer, FFmpeg, DeepStream) |
| WebRTC (WHEP) | `http://103.250.160.189:8889/stream/<id>/whep` | Public IP (direct) | Low-latency browser preview |

- `<id>` = camera id, format **`cam01` … `cam30`**
- **Catalogue (real endpoint, replaces the generic `/api/ingest`):**
  ```
  curl -s https://cctv.corp8.cloud/cameras.json
  ```
  Start from this catalogue rather than hard-coding — the camera set can change.

### Connecting — updated code examples

**OpenCV (Python) — HLS (remote) or RTSP (on-network):**
```python
import os, cv2
# HLS (works anywhere with your session):
cap = cv2.VideoCapture("https://cctv.corp8.cloud/cam04/index.m3u8", cv2.CAP_FFMPEG)
# RTSP (direct — force TCP):
os.environ["OPENCV_FFMPEG_CAPTURE_OPTIONS"] = "rtsp_transport;tcp"
cap = cv2.VideoCapture("rtsp://103.250.160.189:8554/stream/cam04", cv2.CAP_FFMPEG)
while True:
    ok, frame = cap.read()
    if not ok: break            # reconnect
    pts_ms = cap.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_POS_MSEC)
```

**GStreamer (RTSP):**
```
gst-launch-1.0 rtspsrc location=rtsp://103.250.160.189:8554/stream/cam04 protocols=tcp latency=200 \
  ! rtph264depay ! h264parse ! avdec_h264 ! videoconvert ! fakesink
```

**FFmpeg / ffprobe:**
```
ffplay -rtsp_transport tcp rtsp://103.250.160.189:8554/stream/cam04
ffplay https://cctv.corp8.cloud/cam04/index.m3u8
```

### Do's and don'ts (condensed — same substance as §13.3, reconfirmed here)
- Force RTSP over TCP; use HLS if port 8554 is blocked.
- Never trust `CAP_PROP_FPS`; use timestamps for any speed/dwell/time metric.
- Drive timing from PTS, never arrival time (buffered GOP replay on connect can arrive faster than real time).
- Don't assume constant frame rate; tolerate inter-frame gaps.
- Reconnect with exponential backoff (~2s → cap ~30s); never tight-loop.
- Join-time decode warnings (mixed H.264/H.265, "Could not find ref with POC") are normal, not fatal.
- Expect a scene discontinuity at each feed's loop point; long-lived state must recover from the hard cut.
- No file download — the grid is consumed live only; build against live capture from the start.
- Pace your load: each client gets its own stream copy; open only cameras being processed, close when done.

### Pre-submission checklist (updated)
- [ ] RTSP clients force TCP; remote clients use HLS
- [ ] No timing logic depends on `CAP_PROP_FPS` or frame arrival time
- [ ] Inter-frame gaps do not crash or stall the pipeline
- [ ] Reconnect with backoff implemented and tested
- [ ] Decoder warnings on join are logged, not fatal
- [ ] Camera list read from `cameras.json`; mixed H.264/H.265 and resolutions handled
- [ ] Behaviour is sane across a scene discontinuity (loop point)

### Support
Report feed problems with: camera id, exact URL, client + version, UTC timestamp, client-side error log. Confirm the camera's status on the live grid before reporting it down.
