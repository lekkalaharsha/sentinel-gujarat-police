"""Regression coverage for GET /vehicle/event/{event_id}/crop's department
scoping (api/routes_vehicle.py's vehicle_event_crop).

Real bug found 2026-09-13 while verifying an RBAC fix end-to-end: an earlier
version of this endpoint gated VIEWING on `evidence_class.is_exportable()`,
which meant any non-CONFIRMED sighting's crop 404'd even for its own
department. Checked against the live sentinel.db: 12,274 of 12,280 saved
crops (99.95%) are non-CONFIRMED, so that version broke evidence viewing for
nearly every sighting in the app. Viewing must NOT be gated on evidence
class — only an actual export/download action should be (enforced
separately, in the frontend, via `exportable_as_evidence`). Department
scoping (added in the same fix) is correct and stays: a viewer outside the
owning department gets 404; an investigator outside it is allowed through
but the access is audited.
