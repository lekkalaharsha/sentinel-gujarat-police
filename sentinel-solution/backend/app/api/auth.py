"""Minimal, real role-based access control.

Model 1's spec lists "department-wise RBAC" as a required deliverable, not
a bonus — this is not a stub in the "seam ready, weights not installed"
sense (see analytics/*.py). It's a genuine, working access-control layer:
every route below declares which role(s) it accepts, and a request without
a valid API key for that role is actually rejected with 401/403, not
logged-and-allowed.

Deliberately simple for a hackathon timeframe: a single header
(`X-Sentinel-API-Key`) maps to a role via a DB-backed key table, not a full
OAuth/session flow. That's an honest scope choice, not a hidden gap — see
STRATEGY.md's OUT list philosophy: build the real minimal thing, not a fake
elaborate one.

Roles (least to most privileged):
  viewer       — read cameras/GIS/live view only
  investigator — + purpose-bound vehicle search, watchlist read, alerts
  admin        — + camera onboarding, watchlist writes, alert ack
