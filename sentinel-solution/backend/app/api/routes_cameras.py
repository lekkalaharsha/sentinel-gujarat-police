    a camera can be "registered" (in CameraRegistry, with department/GIS
    metadata) independently of whether it's currently live in the
    catalogue. Earlier versions of this endpoint only read the live
    catalogue and silently dropped department/lat/lon/health — merging both
    sources here is the actual fix for that.

    Takes an already-fetched `registry` row rather than fetching it itself:
    `list_cameras` used to call this once per camera, each doing its own
    `session.get()` — an N+1 that's harmless at 30 cameras but directly
    undercuts the 80k-camera scalability story. Batch-fetching once in the
    caller and passing the row in fixes both that AND a redundant second
    fetch `get_camera` was doing (fetch once, then call this, which fetched
    again). Found by software-engineering review 2026-09-04.

    `include_raw_urls` gates `rtsp_url`/`whep_url`: both embed the real
    sandbox login (`email:password@`, see catalogue.py) directly in the
    URL. The frontend never reads either field — it plays video through
    the authenticated HLS proxy (routes_stream.py) via `hls_url` only — so
    a `viewer`-role key has no legitimate need for them. Found by security
    review 2026-09-04: any viewer key could extract the actual government
    sandbox credentials through this endpoint. Restricted to admin."""
