"""Cross-camera vehicle identity resolution.

This is the fix for "plate not readable -> tracking failed." Implements:

    Camera 1: plate ❌, white SUV, embedding e1
    Camera 2: plate ❌, white SUV, embedding e2  (~e1, similar) -> same identity
    Camera 3: plate ✅ GJ01AB1234, embedding e3  (~e1/e2, similar)
              -> identity upgraded to GJ01AB1234
              -> camera 1 and 2 sightings retroactively belong to this plate

We never claim a plate identity before it's actually observed — an
anonymous identity stays anonymous until ANPR succeeds on ANY of its
sightings; only then does the whole chain resolve to that plate. See
STRATEGY.md's "plate-first, appearance-second" principle: plate is the
strongest signal, appearance is what carries identity through the gaps.

GEO-FEASIBILITY GATE (added after running this against continuous live
sandbox traffic, not synthetic data): appearance-only matching used to be
pure cosine similarity against every identity in the time window, with no
check on whether the candidate's last-known camera was even physically
reachable. Under real, high-volume, multi-camera traffic, this let an
identity drift across ~100 unrelated real vehicles across the state within
15 minutes — any sufficiently common colour/shape (grey sedan, silver
hatchback) would match, regardless of distance. Every appearance-match
candidate is now also checked against the same haversine/plausible-speed
physics used in geo.py's forward/backward feasibility filters: if reaching
the candidate's last camera from the new sighting's camera would require an
implausible speed, it's excluded from consideration entirely, not just
deprioritised. Same honesty stance as geo.py: if either camera lacks GPS,
the check can't be assessed and does NOT block the match (an incomplete
registry must not make the system silently over-reject). Same evidence-based
gate also applies to non-positive elapsed time between two sightings (e.g.
cross-thread clock skew): distant cameras still get rejected, since clock
skew explains a few seconds of disagreement, not two simultaneous sightings
hundreds of kilometres apart.

# How long an identity stays eligible for cross-camera association after

# thing that decides whether a match is physically plausible. That job now
# belongs to the geo-feasibility gate in _best_match, which reasons about
# actual distance and elapsed time. Before the gate existed, this window was
# the ONLY defense against merging unrelated vehicles, so it had to stay
# tight (15 min); real testing then showed it rejecting a genuinely
# plausible same-vehicle match — a 35-minute, 44 km/h hop between two real
# Ahmedabad-area cameras — before the gate ever got a chance to evaluate it.
# 60 minutes comfortably covers a realistic multi-camera city route at
# MAX_PLAUSIBLE_KMH-bounded speeds (see geo.py) while the gate still rejects
# anything actually implausible within that window.

# compensating work when GPS is present, and the actual demo-lead camera
# (cam06) has GPS set. Residual exposure: cameras with no GPS coordinates
