"""Wires a single video Frame through the full chain:

    detect vehicle -> locate plate region -> enhance -> OCR
        -> temporal fusion (tracker.py, within-camera)
        -> Re-ID embedding -> cross-camera identity resolution (identity.py)
        -> persist -> watchlist check

Called by StreamManager for each sampled frame.

Core design principle (see STRATEGY.md / the "what if we can't see the
plate" discussion): ANPR failure must not mean tracking failure.

    Plate not readable
            v
    Don't discard the vehicle
            v
    Generate a vehicle fingerprint (colour + type + appearance embedding)
            v
    Track it as an anonymous identity across cameras
            v
    Upgrade to a real plate the moment ANY sighting reads one

A single OCR read is also unreliable on its own (glare/blur/angle on one
frame), so within a camera we don't trust frame 1 — plate reads are
majority-voted across the whole time a vehicle is in view (tracker.py)
before ever reaching the identity resolver.
