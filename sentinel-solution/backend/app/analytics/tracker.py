"""Within-camera tracking, purely to support temporal fusion.

Association (deciding "is this detection the same vehicle as last frame")
now prefers Ultralytics' real ByteTrack when the detector supplies a
`track_id` (see `detector.py`'s `YoloVehicleDetector`, which calls
`model.track(..., tracker="bytetrack.yaml")`). This class's own IOU-overlap
matching is the fallback for when no external track_id is available — the
stub detector (no ByteTrack), or a detection ByteTrack hasn't confirmed
into a track yet. Both paths converge on the same `Track` accumulation
logic below, so temporal fusion (plate-vote consensus, motion attributes)
works identically regardless of which association method placed the
observation into a track.

Why this matters: a single OCR read is unreliable (glare/blur/angle on any
one frame). A vehicle is visible across several sampled frames as it
crosses the camera's view; voting across those reads is far more reliable
than trusting frame 1. See the "what happens if we can't see the plate"
discussion — this is the fix for the case where *some* frames read fine
and others don't, not the case where *no* frame ever does (that's the
attribute-fallback path in attributes.py / routes_vehicle.py).
